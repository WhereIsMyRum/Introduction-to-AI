<!--### Mancala AI
This is a project fro Introduction to Artificial Intelligence project 2019
The code was entirely written by Piotr PoÅ‚cik.
This project contains a rather simple implementation of basic version of Mancala board game with simple UI 
created using tkinter. 
The implemented AI is a MiniMax Algorithm with alpha/beta pruning.
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 (did not check if the code is backward compatible with older Python version, but I assume it should be)
- installed numpy module
### Running
- First, make sure you have numpy installed
```
pip3 install numpy
```
- In the default setup MiniMax of depth 2 plays against MiniMax of depth 7. 
- To play against the AI simply comment the suggested lines in the mancala.py (no console arguments were added)
- To run the game simply use
``` 
python manacala.py
```
Enjoy!
### Comments
A basic implementation of Monte Carlo Tree search algorithm is also included in the files, although it was not tested thourughly for correctness, 
as the main algorithm was the MiniMax algorithm.-->

<p class="why">
  This project was created during Introduction to Artificail Intelligence course, during my MSc of Computer Science and Engineering stuides.

<h3 class="what">What</h3>
<div class="what">
  This is an implementation of the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mancala">Mancala</a> (also known as Kalaha) game, that allows the player to play against an AI, or against another player.
  The implementation consists of two main parts:
  <ul>
    <li> Simple GUI implemented using tkinter </li>
    <li> The AI implementation </li>
  </ul>
</div>
<h3 class="how">How</h3>
  <div class="how">Three different algorithms can be found in this implementation:
    <ul>
      <li><a target="_blank"  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax">MiniMax</a></li>
      <li>MiniMax with <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning">Alpha-beta pruning</a>
